## Brief Description of the Workshop

*Workshop intends to teach the verilog coding guidelines that results in predictable logic in Silicon. It is important to note that every verilog code is not synthesizable and even if it is , it may result in different logic depending on the coding styles used. The course details all these aspects of the Verilog HDL with theory and backed with lot of practical examples. Workshop introduces to the digital logic design using Verilog HDL . Validating the functionality of the design using Functional Simulation. Writing Test Benches to validate the functionality of the RTL design . Logic synthesis of the Functional RTL Code. Gate Level Simulation of the Synthesized Netlist.*

# Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis
On the first day of the workshop, we learnt about the flow of RTL design to GDSII. We learnt how to use the simulator iVerilog and also learnt about the synthesizer tool Yosys. Synthesizer tool converts an RTL design to netlist.
